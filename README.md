# Redox Project

## Visualizations

### Installation 
- Main dependencies: 
    - shiny, shinylive, matplotlib, pandas, plotly

# Update 
- now it is also deployed on [redoxPlot](https://allanware.shinyapps.io/redoxplot/)
    - shinylive uses pyodide which does not have the dash_bio package pre-included. I haven't figured out how to include it myself.
